electric-power-monitor
======================

Project done for creation labs , VIT

Arduino senses the power consumed by an appliance , and passes the readings on to the computer ( or raspberry pi)

The computer plots the readings using pyplot in real time

The graph adapts to the range of readings (range increases if the readings go out of bounds of the existing range of the plot)

to do
-----

->find a way to downscale the range on the plot once the max reading goes away from view

Known bugs
----------

-> pyplot crashes everytime I try to close it , no solution on stackoverflow -_-
